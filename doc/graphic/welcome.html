<h3>User message</h3>
<b>Commmand:</b>&nbsp;USER<br/>
<b>Parameters:</b>&nbsp;&lt;username&gt; &lt;hostname&gt; &lt;servername&gt; &lt;realname&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The USER message is used at the beginning of connection to specify
<br/> the username, hostname, servername and realname of s new user. It is
<br/> also used in communication between servers to indicate new user
<br/> arriving on IRC, since only after both USER and NICK have been
<br/> received from a client does a user become registered.
<br/>
<br/> Between servers USER must to be prefixed with client's NICKname.
<br/> Note that hostname and servername are normally ignored by the IRC
<br/> server when the USER command comes from a directly connected client
<br/> (for security reasons), but they are used in server to server
<br/> communication. This means that a NICK must always be sent to a
<br/> remote server when a new user is being introduced to the rest of the
<br/> network before the accompanying USER is sent.
<br/>
<br/> It must be noted that realname parameter must be the last parameter,
<br/> because it may contain space characters and must be prefixed with a
<br/> colon (':') to make sure this is recognised as such.
<br/>
<br/> Since it is easy for a client to lie about its username by relying
<br/> solely on the USER message, the use of an "Identity Server" is
<br/> recommended. If the host which a user connects from has such a
<br/> server enabled the username is set to that as in the reply from the
<br/> "Identity Server".
